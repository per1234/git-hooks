### Installation
Copy the desired script into `.git/hooks` and rename it according to the folder name the script came from. For example, if you wanted to install `pre-commit/check-code-formatting`, you should copy it to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`. The hook script may have configuration options that you can edit.
